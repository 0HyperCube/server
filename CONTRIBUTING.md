## Formatting Rules
- Methods should follow PascalFormat
- If using `{}` please fully expand
- Field members should start with `m_`, static fields with `s_` (e.g. `m_VariableName`)
- Try to use `var` wherever possible

## Creating a Pull Request
1. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
2. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!
